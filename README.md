# SS Proj

This school project was created for the [SS (Sistemski Softver, en. System Software) course][ss], 
which is part of the Bachelor's studies at the [School of Electrical Engineering][school], [University of Belgrade][uni].

This project consisted of two parts:
 1. an assembler for the pre-defined assembly language. 
 The two pass assembler generates a custom object file which can be relocated and linked as needed.
 1. an emulator for a finctional architecture (which was defined in the project statement).
 The interpretive emulator loads a single object file and executes it, while supporting interrupts and i/o byte streams defined in the statement.
